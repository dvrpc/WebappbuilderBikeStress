# DVRPC Bicycle LTS and Connectivity Analysis Web Application

Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) is a road classification scheme based on the comfort of bicyclists in the traffic stream. DVRPC’s LTS assignment is based on the number of lanes, effective vehicle speed, and presence/type of bicycle facility.

Connectivity Analysis was conducted to determine which segments provided the greatest number of connections throughout the region, from every census block to every other census block. The results of this analysis were categorized to assist in the prioritization of bicycle infrastructure improvements. Regional priorities consist of roads that are currently LTS 3. If made more comfortable for cycling (LTS 1 or 2), these roads could enable the most (top 10%) new low-stress connections between Census blocks in their county, compared to other LTS 3 road segments.

[The user guide](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwoRcXMtsVJfZnJJWjF1aGZUVGs) describes the layers included in the LTS webmap and provides helpful tips on using the functionality available in the map interface. Additional information about LTS, connectivity analysis, and the methodology behind the results displayed in the map can be found in the [documentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwoRcXMtsVJfUkh6YkZJcnBWVkU).
The layers and corresponding tables displayed in this map are available for download via [DVRPC’s Open Data portal](https://dvrpc-dvrpcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets?q=Bike%20Stress). 

DVRPC will continue to refine this approach and our tools - if you have any ideas, questions, or comments, please contact Sarah Moran at smoran@dvrpc.org.
